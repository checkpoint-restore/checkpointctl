== Name

*checkpointctl-build* - Create OCI image from a checkpoint tar file.

== Synopsis

*checkpointctl build* CHECKPOINT_PATH IMAGE_NAME

== Options

*-h*, *--help*::
  Show help for checkpointctl build

== Description

Create an OCI image from a container checkpoint archive (tar file) using `buildah`.
The checkpoint metadata is extracted from the archive and applied as OCI image annotations,
allowing the container runtime (Podman, CRI-O, containerd) to identify the image as a checkpoint.

Usage Example:
  `checkpointctl build checkpoint.tar quay.io/foo/bar:latest`
  `buildah push quay.io/foo/bar:latest`
